# Obsidian Pentesting Template
This is a simplified sample pentest report that I use for HackTheBox, TryHackMe, and other platforms.

### Notes

The report includes the main phases I follow when enumerating, exploiting, and escalating privileges on target machines. Feel free to download and customise it according to your specific requirements.

Happy hacking!
